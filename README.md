# high-pass-project
Photography studio web-page as a project for Skillbox learning platform. I used HTML, Sass/SCSS and a bit of JavaScript (just for making some of the elements "alive"). Also I used Gulp-builder by maxdenaro (aka MaxGraph). So one of the point of this project is CSS Grid practice.
